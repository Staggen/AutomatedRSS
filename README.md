# AutomatedRSS
Group project for the C# course
ToDo:
1. Handle exceptions, there are tons of them which are currently not thrown or caught.
2. Update the storage files to appropriate formats, so they are not all just .txt files.
3. Fix the update frequency on the feeds so that it actually does something.
4. Rework feeds so that they are used as objects of the class FeedList (List<Feed>).
5. Rework and refactor everything, time and time again until it is optimal.
